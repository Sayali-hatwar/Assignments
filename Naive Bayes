Naive Bayes is a popular and simple probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. 
It is commonly used for classification tasks, especially in natural language processing and text classification applications.
Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well and is computationally efficient, making it a popular choice for many real-world problems.
The algorithm is based on the assumption of feature independence given the class label. This means that it assumes all features are conditionally independent 
of each other, given the class label.
